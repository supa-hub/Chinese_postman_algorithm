# Chinese_postman_algorithm
A self made algorithm that automates the chinese postman algorithm.

The code is currently under development and is is not fully functional yet. 

After the code is released as v1.0, it will have these features:
To take the given information of a matrix or a mathematical graph and utilise the chinese postman algorithm with the given data.
Tell the shortest length to traverse every vertex of the mathematical graph.
Tell the route that has the shortest length mentioned before.
Utilise djikstra's algorithm to find the shortest route between pairs of odd verteces (as this is required in the chinese postman algoritm)
Then to be able to return this information in the form of a python dictionary. This dictionary has the same kind of structure as a javascript dictionary.


The code will be updated as these features are being added.
