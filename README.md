# Chinese_postman_algorithm
A self made algorithm that automates the chinese postman algorithm.<br />

The code is currently under development and is is not fully functional yet. <br />

After the code is released as v1.0, it will have these features:<br />
To take the given information of a matrix or a mathematical graph and utilise the chinese postman algorithm with the given data.<br />
Tell the shortest length to traverse every vertex of the mathematical graph.<br />
Tell the route that has the shortest length mentioned before.<br />
Utilise djikstra's algorithm to find the shortest route between pairs of odd verteces (as this is required in the chinese postman algoritm)<br />
Then to be able to return this information in the form of a python dictionary. This dictionary has the same kind of structure as a javascript dictionary.<br />
<br />

The code will be updated as these features are being added. Currently studying for high school finals tests, which is why coding is temporarily on hold.<br />
